# Distributed Ledger System a Hardhat Project

This project demonstrates a basic Hardhat use case.
It has a solidity file , script files and test files for proper building , testing and deploying the blockchain environment
We are using the Polygon platform for the deployment of blockchain environment


Try running some of the following tasks:

```shell
first install Node js
npm install --save-dev hardhat                                  (installing hardhat) 
npx hardhat                                                     (for Creating new sample project)
npx hardhat compile                                             (for Compiling the Solidity file)
npx hardhat test                                                (testing the code)
npx hardhat node                                                (if deploying on localhost then we na use node function to get some of the user's private and addresses for our uses)
npx hardhat run scripts/sample-scripts.js --network Mumbai      (if deploying on server we can use Mumbai as a sample server)
npx hardhat help                                                (if u have any queries u can also go for the docs ":)" )
